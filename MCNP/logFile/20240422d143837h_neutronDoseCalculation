*****Load pre-defined HU conversion properties and MCNP cross sections from conversionCT2tissue.mat.Note: Modification of conversionCT2tissue.mat using generateVar_conversionCT2tissue.m.**********Properties from (scaled) HU loaded are: Minimum value: -1024 and Maximum value: 0.[Warning: No information on rescale slope and/or intercept provided in DICOM data. Calculation might crash...] 
Please use question dialog to decide how to convert to scaled HU.**********You decided not to use DICOM rescale slope and intercept.**********Properties from rescaled HU are: Minimum value: 0 and Maximum value: 1000.*****Material types are assigned using the following HU intervals...air: 0 to 50lung: 50 to 830softTissue: 830 to 1280bone: 1280 to 5000*****Segmentation via HU intervals led to zero voxels with lung tissue.
*****
Skin thickness has been set to: 1 mm.

*****
In case you wish to simulate BNCT irradiation make sure the PTV is called PTV_BNCT.
*****
Checking for PTV...
*****
No PTV for BNCT detected.
*****
Segmentation process performed sucessfully.
*****Calculate density from CT data with density given in [g/cm^3]********Neutron spectrum load from machine file.
***
Gamma/photon spectrum found in neutron machine. Will be included in the simulation as primary particles.
